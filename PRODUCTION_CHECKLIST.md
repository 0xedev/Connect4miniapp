# 🚀 Production Deployment Checklist

## Prerequisites ✅

- [x] Frontend build successful
- [x] TypeScript errors resolved
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Railway account set up
- [ ] Backend deployed to Railway
- [ ] Frontend environment updated with backend URL

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend to Railway

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy backend
cd backend
railway deploy
```

**Railway Configuration:**

- Root Directory: `backend`
- Build Command: `npm install`
- Start Command: `npm start`

**Environment Variables to set in Railway:**

```
NODE_ENV=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://4tune.vercel.app
PORT=$PORT
```

### 2. Update Frontend Environment

Once Railway gives you a backend URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`), update your Vercel environment variables:

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
REACT_APP_DAILY_API_KEY=2f15f060f12622bd008df19ec22cb07ae97a918e0f07236a03a2ac5ea83a3f1f
REACT_APP_DAILY_DOMAIN=4tu.daily.co
```

### 3. Redeploy Frontend

In Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Update environment variables
3. Trigger a new deployment

## Testing Checklist 🧪

- Railway free tier: 500 hours/month
- Daily.co: Check your plan limits
- Vercel: Unlimited for hobby projects

### When to Scale Up

- **Concurrent Users**: > 50 simultaneous users
- **Monthly Hours**: Approaching Railway limits
- **Voice Minutes**: Approaching Daily.co limits

### Scaling Options

1. **Railway**: Upgrade to paid plan ($5/month)
2. **Redis**: Add Redis for horizontal scaling
3. **Load Balancer**: Use multiple backend instances
4. **CDN**: Add Cloudflare for better performance

## Security Best Practices 🔒

- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Rate limiting enabled
- [x] Helmet.js for security headers
- [x] Environment variables not exposed
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] Regular dependency updates

## Launch Strategy 🎯

### Soft Launch
